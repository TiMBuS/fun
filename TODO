Add more builtins, I guess
Maybe make file I/O simpler, particularly the O part. Make it so say/print can print to files perhaps instead of fwrite/fput/etc

Look into adding a .const pmc for the stack instead of using get_global. It should be a lot faster. <-- Maybe give up on this one.
Maybe roll your own strftime
Make an interface to declare and call c functions <- holy freakin crap this is going to suck so bad
