Add more builtins, I guess
W/R/T [P] calls: Look into all the deepcopy calls you make. There are far too many, and I'm sure a lot can be removed.
Look into adding a .const pmc for the stack instead of using get_global. It should be a lot faster. <-- Maybe give up on this one.
Maybe roll your own strftime
Make an interface to declare and call c functions <- holy freakin crap this is going to suck so bad
