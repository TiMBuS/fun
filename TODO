Make continuations not break 'stack'
Perhaps add a 'char' type? Hmm. Probably a good idea.
Add more builtins i guess
Look into adding a .const pmc for the stack instead of using get_global. It should be a lot faster.
Make an interface to declare and call c functions <- holy freakin crap this is going to suck so bad
