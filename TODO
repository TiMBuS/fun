The recursive functions are all pure functions. Maybe you should memoize them? For certain cases at least?
Add objects.
W/R/T [P] calls: Look into all the deepcopy calls you make. There are far too many, and I'm sure a lot can be removed.

Maybe roll your own strftime
Make an interface to declare and call c functions <- just use parrots NCI and hope the jit can do it.

CONSIDER: All functions with a continuation-based predicate suck. It's inconsistant, it takes overhead that could be avoided using dup. I don't see why it needs to stay.
CONSIDER: A way to make list copies take less overhead. Lazy copies might work if data was actually immutable.
