Ignore:
  true: It's a type not a function.
  false: It's a type not a function.
  help: Use the manual.
  helpdetail: Use the manual.
  manual: Fun uses POD.
  conts: Broken in joy and near useless in fun anyway.
  set: Sets aren't in fun.
  ifset: Sets aren't in fun.
  setsize: Sets aren't in fun.
  id: This function literally does nothing.
  abort: Difficult to add, and would probably be terribly confusing since fun runs backwards.
  putch: Feels out of place. just use 'chr print'
  app1: Same as unary, and broken in joy. If someone give me a good reason to add this I will.
  app11: Also broken in joy, seems to serve no real purpose.
  app12: Confusing and could just as well be done using [unary2 pop].

Alts:
  - compare: 'cmp'
    rationale: Shorter, more common.
  - succ: '++'
    rationale: Shorter, more common.
  - pred: '--'
    rationale: Shorter, more common.
    
  - ifinteger: 'ifint'
    rationale: Shorter type name. 
  - iffloat: 'ifnum'
    rationale: Shorter type name.
  - ifstring: 'ifstr'
    rationale: Shorter type name.
  - iflogical: 'ifbool'
    rationale: Shorter type name.
    
  - integer: 'int?'
    rationale: More apparant it is a predicate.
  - float: 'num?'
    rationale: More apparant it is a predicate.
  - char: 'char?'
    rationale: More apparant it is a predicate.
  - string: 'str?'
    rationale: More apparant it is a predicate.
  - list: 'list?'
    rationale: More apparant it is a predicate.
  - logical: 'bool?'
    rationale: More apparant it is a predicate.
  - file: 'file?'
    rationale: More apparant it is a predicate.

  - some: 'any'
    rationale: Any/all 'feels' more right to me.
    
  - fputstring: 'fputchars'
    rationale: Unneeded duplicate function.
    
  - app2: 'unary2'
    rationale: Unneeded duplicate function.
  - app3: 'unary3'
    rationale: Unneeded duplicate function.
  - app4: 'unary4'
    rationale: Unneeded duplicate function.

  - formatf: 'format'
    rationale: It was trivial to make format also take a float. formatf is a confusing function name anyway.
